    <h1>Our mission</h1>
        <p>
            To unlock fun through learning. The goal is inject learning material that is quick and non intrusive while the kids are being entertained. It is similar to ads between videos but we want to replace the ads with suitable educational contents. 
            As it is costly to make education as fun as video games/entertainment videos, the idea is to inject the educational contents for seconds and catch his attention by asking him to continue to the next video or answer a question. 
            The goal is to expose the kid to educational contents while watching and in the future playing for very brief moments in time to catch his attention and at the same time not disrupt his fun.

    <h1>About us</h1>  
        <p>We are parents first, and developers second. During the pandemic we noticed kids are on youtube for many hours. We wanted to exploit this phenomena to inject educational conent in between. The idea is to supplement his learning as well as not to disturb his fun time.

    <p> This site allows to search and play YouTube videos. However,
    before playing each video, you will be prompted to answer a quiz correctly
    in order to play the video!</p>
    <p>PLEASE NOTE: The site is in its first stages and more features will be added over time.
        All current features are fully functional though.</p>
